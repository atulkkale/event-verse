# Event Verse

**Event Verse** is a feature-rich project that includes both frontend and backend components. Built using React.js and TanStack Query, the project provides a seamless interface for managing and exploring user-created events. The backend is a simple Node.js application using the file system module for data storage, allowing the primary focus to remain on React development.

## Features

- **Event Management**: Users can create events, view all events, and explore detailed information about each event.
- **Search Functionality**: The homepage includes a search bar to help users find specific events.
- **Event Details Page**: Users can view more information about an event by clicking the "View Details" button.
- **Create Event Form**: A form for users to add new events. Currently, users can only select images from a provided set.
- **[Backend](https://github.com/atulkkale/event-verse-backend)**: A simple Node.js backend manages event data using the file system module.

## Technologies Used
